#Hadley's Presentation from November 2016
The purpose of this project is to code each of the eight examples from Hadley's November 2016 talk at the NYC Datavis meetup: [https://speakerdeck.com/hadley/eight-visualisation-challenges-with-ggplot2](https://speakerdeck.com/hadley/eight-visualisation-challenges-with-ggplot2)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
```

##Challenge 1: Labelling Plots

New labelling layers are:
Title
Subtitle
Caption

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy))+
  geom_point(aes(color = class))+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "loess")+
  labs(
    title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception because of their light weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )
